# Admin-Dashboard

In this project, I will be putting together everything that I learned throughout the intermediate CSS and HTML course into one project.

This project will be a dashboard containing some dummy links on the left side, some personal information and icons at the top of the page, and some links to my projects as the main portion of the page. This project will mainly be about styling and using HTML concepts that I learned in this section of the course will very little backend functionality.
